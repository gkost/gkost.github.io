# Introduction

Thank you for using Kitty Dreams! Your trust is important to me and I am committed to protecting the privacy and security of your personal information.


# Information Collection

Your privacy is critically important to me. I have the following fundamental principles:



* I don’t ask you for personal information unless I need it for the application.
* I don’t share/sell your personal information with anyone.
* I don’t store your personal information.
* I don’t transfer any personal information from your mobile.

All information is used only for the Wear OS Watch Face functionality purposes (display and configuration).

The only data transferred from the application are usage statistics (like when you hit a button). Usage statistics help me track the most used features, and help me improve the application. They are completely anonymous.


# Information and Permission Usage

This application use only necessary permissions as described below:


### In-app purchases



* This permission is required to make a donation and get the Premium Features, when using a free watch face.


### Fitness data



* Read activity \
This permission is required if you choose to display one of those 2 datas : “Burned calories” which shows the daily burned calories, and the “Step counter” which shows the daily steps count.
* Read location \
This permission is required if you choose to display the “Moved distance” data on one of the widget. This data shows the daily kilometers/miles walked.


### Location



* Precise location (GPS and network-based) \
This permission is required to get your last known location. Your location will be sent to the weather provider, to get current weather conditions according to your specific location. \
The location is not used if you do not use the “Weather” widget.


### Photos/Media/Files



* Read modify or delete the contents of your USB storage \
This permission is required to allow the app to store usage data and local settings in the memory of your mobile, so that it will be persistent. \
It only writes one file, and reads nothing else than this specific file. No other content is accessed (no pictures or anything else). Android does provide specific permission granularity to specify the type of file accessed, that is why it is mentioned as “Photos/Media/Files”.

This permission is required to allow the usage of heart rate monitors.


### Others



* View network connections & full network access \
This permission is required to pull data from third party providers: \
Used for Google Maps, to allow you to choose a manual location. \
Used to get the weather conditions at your current location.
